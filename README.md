This script takes advantage of the cyberpunk 2077 space oddity money glitch.

Inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tDKJVCnurU

Preconfigs:

1. You need to fix your game for virtual inputs!
Follow this instruction: https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kb73fr/fix_for_virtual_input_not_working/

2. Install Python (tested on 3.8.6)
3. Install requirements.txt

I tested it on my FullHD Screen with a resolution of 1920x1080.
Maybe you have to change your resolution.
I cannot guarantee that it will work flawlessly on your system.

For the mouse navigation the script makes a screenshot in some places.
Since I have a german game, you may have to change your screenshots accordingly:
- empty.png # if the store is empty and the balance is 25
- in_store.png # equal to 'sort'
- wait.png # wait a specific time, in the i-menu

Instruction:

1. Get the item from the mission
2. Go to a dropbox and stand in front of it
3. Tab out and launch the script
4. Go back in the game within 3 seconds 
5. Get your millions :)
